# Tableau Data Visualization Summary

This part focuses on using Tableau to analyze a dataset and create visualizations based on the Course: Data Visualization and Communication with Tableau by Duke University Via Coursera. 
Here’s a summary of the key topics and steps involved in drawing charts:

## Connecting to Data
- Download the salary dataset from the course website and save it on your computer.
- Open Tableau and connect to the Excel file containing the dataset.

## Preparing Data
- Tableau automatically interprets the dataset, classifying variables as **measures** or **dimensions**.
- Adjust variable types if necessary (e.g., changing a string to a date or number).

## Understanding the Tableau Workspace
- Familiarize yourself with the layout, including the **variables section**, **toolbar**, and **shelves** (Rows and Columns).
- Use the **Show Me** card to explore different chart options based on your data.

## Creating Your First Chart
- Drag the **Paid Wage Per Year** variable to the **Rows shelf** and **Job Title Subgroup** to the **Columns shelf** to create a graph.
- Adjust the aggregation method (e.g., change from **SUM** to **AVERAGE** or **MEDIAN**) to accurately represent the data.

## Finalizing the Visualization
- Review the chart to ensure it displays meaningful information, such as average wages for different job titles.
- Explore additional features and options in Tableau to enhance your analysis and visualizations.
